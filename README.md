### 📊 Machine Learning Web App (Streamlit)

This project shows how to build a machine learning web application from scratch using Python and Streamlit. It follows the workflow from data analysis and model training to deploying an interactive web app that makes predictions.

🚀 Project Overview

#### ✔This repository contains:

#### ✔A trained machine learning model

#### ✔A Streamlit web app to interact with the model

#### ✔Code for data preprocessing, model training, and app UI

#### ✔Simple tools to run and explore predictions in your browser

🗂️ Repository Structure (Example)

```plaintext
├── app.py              # Streamlit application script
├── model.pkl           # Saved machine learning model
├── train_model.py      # Script to train the ML model
├── requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
├── data/               # Datasets used for training
└── README.md

```

🛠️ Setup & Installation

Clone the repository
https://github.com/Abedulaziz01/DevSalary-ML-Model-with-Streamlit.git

Install required packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🧠 Train the ML Model

Use the training script to process your data and train a model:

```
python train_model.py
```

After training, the model will be saved as model.pkl for use in the web app.

🌐 Run the Web App

To start the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open showing the interactive interface where users can input values and see model predictions.

📊 Features

✔ Load and preprocess data
